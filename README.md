# 🐶 BugHound

BugHound is a small, agent-style debugging tool. It analyzes a Python code snippet, proposes a fix, and runs basic reliability checks before deciding whether the fix is safe to apply automatically.

## What BugHound Does

Given a short Python snippet, BugHound:

1. **Analyzes** the code for potential issues  
   - Uses heuristics in offline mode  
   - Uses Gemini when API access is enabled  

2. **Proposes a fix**  
   - Either heuristic-based or LLM-generated  
   - Attempts minimal, behavior-preserving changes  

3. **Assesses risk**  
   - Scores the fix  
   - Flags high-risk changes  
   - Decides whether the fix should be auto-applied or reviewed by a human  

4. **Shows its work**  
   - Displays detected issues  
   - Shows a diff between original and fixed code  
   - Logs each agent step

## Setup

### 1. Create a virtual environment (recommended)

```bash
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate   # macOS/Linux
# or
.venv\Scripts\activate      # Windows
```

### 2. Install dependencies

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

---

## Running in Offline (Heuristic) Mode

No API key required.

```bash
streamlit run bughound_app.py
```

In the sidebar, select:

* **Model mode:** Heuristic only (no API)

This mode uses simple pattern-based rules and is useful for testing the workflow without network access.

## Running with Gemini

### 1. Set up your API key

Copy the example file:

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

Edit `.env` and add your Gemini API key:

```text
GEMINI_API_KEY=your_real_key_here
```

### 2. Run the app

```bash
streamlit run bughound_app.py
```

In the sidebar, select:

* **Model mode:** Gemini (requires API key)
* Choose a Gemini model and temperature

BugHound will now use Gemini for analysis and fix generation, while still applying local reliability checks.

---

## Running Tests

Tests focus on **reliability logic** and **agent behavior**, not the UI.

```bash
pytest
```

You should see tests covering:

* Risk scoring and guardrails
* Heuristic fallbacks when LLM output is invalid
* End-to-end agent workflow shape

## Student Learning Summary

The core concept students needed to understand was that agent outputs are proposals, not truth, so every step needs validation and explicit guardrails. The most common struggle point was separating issue detection quality from fix quality, because a correct diagnosis can still produce a risky or malformed rewrite. AI was most helpful for quickly drafting candidate fixes and surfacing likely issues, especially in repetitive patterns like bare except and print usage. AI was most misleading when output formatting looked confident but violated the expected structure or changed too much code at once. I would guide a student by asking them to trace one failing example through plan, analyze, act, test, and reflect, then identify exactly where trust should drop. This keeps ownership of the reasoning with the student while still giving them a clear path to debug the system behavior.
